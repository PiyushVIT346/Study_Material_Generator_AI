**Intermediate Physics Study Guide**

**Energy and Work**

**Definition**: Energy is the ability to do work, and work is the transfer of energy from one object to another.

**Key Concepts**:

* Kinetic Energy (KE): energy of motion
* Potential Energy (PE): energy of position or stored energy
* Thermal Energy: energy of heat
* Law of Energy Conservation: energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another
* Work-Energy Theorem**: the net work done on an object is equal to its change in kinetic energy**

**Practical Examples:
1. A roller coaster converts potential energy to kinetic energy as it drops.
2. A car engine converts chemical energy into kinetic energy.

**Visual Diagram**: A graph showing the conversion of potential energy and kinetic energy as a roller coaster drops.

**Summary Points**:

* Work is the transfer of energy from one object to another.
* Energy comes in different forms (kinetic, potential, thermal).
* The work-energy theorem relates work and energy.

**Momentum and Collisions**

**Definition**: Momentum is the product of an object's mass and velocity.

**Key Concepts**:

* Momentum Conservation: the total momentum remains constant in a closed system
* Elastic Collisions: collisions where kinetic energy is conserved
* Inelastic Collisions: collisions where kinetic energy is not conserved
* Coefficient of Restitution (COR): a measure of how much kinetic energy is lost in a collision
* Momentum Conservation in Real-World Scenarios: car crashes, billiard balls, and rockets

**Practical Examples:
1. A car crash: momentum is conserved, but kinetic energy is lost.
2. A billiard ball collision: momentum is conserved, and kinetic energy is transferred.

**Visual Diagram**: A diagram showing the momentum vectors before and after a collision.

**Summary Points**:

* Momentum is a product of mass and velocity.
* Momentum is conserved in closed systems.
* Collisions can be elastic or inelastic.

**Rotational Motion and Torque**

**Definition**: Rotational motion is the motion of an object around a fixed axis.

**Key Concepts**:

* Angular Momentum: a measure of an object's tendency to keep rotating
* Torque: a measure of the rotational force that causes an object to rotate
* Moment of Inertia: a measure of an object's resistance to changes in rotation
* Equations of Motion for Rotational Motion**: equations that describe the motion
* Relationship between Torque and Angular Acceleration: torque causes angular acceleration

**Practical Examples:
1. A spinning top: torque causes angular acceleration.
2. A wheel on a car: torque causes the wheel to rotate.

**Visual Diagram**: A diagram showing the torque vectors and the resulting angular acceleration.

**Summary Points**:

* Rotational motion is motion around a fixed axis.
* Angular momentum is a measure of an object's tendency to keep rotating.
* Torque causes angular acceleration.

**Waves and Oscillations**

**Definition**: Waves are periodic disturbances that transfer energy from one point to another.

**Key Concepts**:

* Types of Waves: mechanical and electromagnetic waves
* Wave Properties: amplitude, frequency, wavelength, and speed
* Wave Behavior: reflection, refraction, and diffraction
* Oscillations: simple harmonic motion, damped, and forced oscillations

**Practical Examples:
1. Water waves: mechanical waves that transfer energy.
2. Light waves: electromagnetic waves that transfer energy.

**Visual Diagram**: A diagram showing the wave properties and behavior.

**Summary Points**:

* Waves transfer energy from one point to another.
* Waves have properties like amplitude, frequency, and speed.
* Oscillations are a type of wave motion.

**Electricity and Circuits**

**Definition**: Electricity is the flow of electric charge.

**Key Concepts**:

* Electric Charge: a fundamental property of matter
* Electric Potential: the potential energy per unit charge
* Resistance and Resistivity: measures of an object's opposition to electric flow
* Ohm's Law: a relationship between voltage, current, and resistance
* Series and Parallel Circuits: types of electric circuits
* Circuit Analysis Techniques: methods for analyzing electric circuits

**Practical Examples:
1. A light bulb: electric current flows through the filament.
2. A circuit: electric current flows through resistors and wires.

**Visual Diagram**: A diagram showing a simple electric circuit.

**Summary Points**:

* Electricity is the flow of electric charge.
* Electric potential is the potential energy per unit charge.
* Ohm's law relates voltage, current, and resistance.
